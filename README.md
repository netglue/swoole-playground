# Swoole Playground

This repo contains a collection of scripts used to learn about and document my experiments with Swoole.

There's quite a lot of stuff on-line but much of the documentation I've found is out of date, lacking in detail or a
bit on the rough side.

If you're interested in this and spot any glaring errors or oversights, I'd appreciate a pull request or an issue so
that things can be improved for the benefit of all mankind ;)

## Requirements

If you want to experiment with what's here, you'll need a recent-ish version of PHP, say 7.1 or 7.2 and have the Swoole
extension installed.

## Helpful Stuff

* Stubs for your IDE at [github.com/swoole/ide-helper](https://github.com/swoole/ide-helper)
* The `/examples` directory in [swoole-src](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src/tree/master/examples)
* Using Google-Translate on [wiki.swoole.com](https://wiki.swoole.com/)
* [swoole.co.uk](https://www.swoole.co.uk) has some english docs
* [Awesome Swoole](https://github.com/swooletw/awesome-swoole)

## Install

Clone, CD to the root and `composer install` to setup any dependencies and the autoloader. This step is not required
for a lot of the examples.
